# fastPTA

To test:
    Go to tests and run
    $ python3 test_functions.py


# Installation

- Clone from `https://github.com/Mauropieroni/fastPTA`
- `python3 -m pip install ./fastPTA` -- you can delete the `fastPTA` folder now.
- [alternatively `python3 -m pip install -e ./fastPTA`, to have changes in the code propagate instanteneously; do not delete `fastPTA` in this case!]
